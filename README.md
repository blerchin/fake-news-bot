# Fake News Bot

This is a bot that generates tweets about #fake news, and general #fakeness. 

## Usage:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

heroku run local web
```


## Add to Corpus
`fake.py` accesses the twitter API to download recent tweets and is
intended to run locally. There's no reason it couldn't run in the cloud,
but since you'll have to do a bunch of cleanup on the corpus... better to do
this at home.

Create `config.json` with your Twitter API credentials:
```
{
    "TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

Run:
```
python fake.py
```
